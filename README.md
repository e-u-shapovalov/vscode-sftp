# SFTP Sync - VS Code extension

SFTP Sync is a maintained fork of the VS Code SFTP extension for syncing local
workspace files with remote servers over SFTP or FTP.

This fork is maintained by [Evgenii Shapovalov](https://github.com/e-u-shapovalov)
in this repository:

https://github.com/e-u-shapovalov/vscode-sftp

The project is developed independently from the earlier upstream forks. The
original MIT license and copyright notice are preserved in `LICENSE`.

## Project status

- VS Code Marketplace: pending.
- VSIX releases: https://github.com/e-u-shapovalov/vscode-sftp/releases
- Issues: https://github.com/e-u-shapovalov/vscode-sftp/issues
- Documentation: see the `docs/` directory in this repository.

## What's changed in 1.0.0

- Fixed Node 22+ SFTP crashes caused by the old bundled `ssh2` dependency.
- Fixed Remote Explorer delete confirmations that silently cancelled the command.
- Fixed the Remote Explorer toolbar refresh so it reloads the whole tree.
- Fixed build-breaking TypeScript errors inherited from the previous codebase.
- Fixed SFTP disconnect handler registration.
- Remote Explorer delete now clearly deletes both the remote item and the local copy.
- Local deletes made through VS Code can now be mirrored to the server after confirmation.
- Removed `watcher.autoDelete`, which silently mirrored external local deletes to the server.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release notes.

VSCode-SFTP enables you to add, edit or delete files within a local directory and have it sync to a remote server directory using different transfer protocols like FTP or SSH. The most basic setup requires only a few lines of configuration with a wide array of specific settings also available to meet the needs of any user. Both powerful and fast, it helps developers save time by allowing the use of a familiar editor and environment.

## Installation

### Method 1 (VSIX release)
To install just follow these steps from within VSCode:
1. Select Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X).
2. If you are replacing another SFTP extension, uninstall or disable it first.
3. Download the `.vsix` file from this repository's releases page.
4. Open "More Action" menu (ellipsis on the top) and click "Install from VSIX...".
5. Locate the VSIX file and select it.
6. Reload VS Code.

### Method 2 (Marketplace)
Marketplace publication is pending. This README will be updated with the
Marketplace link when the extension is published.

## Usage
If the latest files are already on a remote server, you can start with an empty local folder,
then download your project, and from that point sync.

1. In `VS Code`, open a local directory you wish to sync to the remote server (or create an empty directory
that you wish to first download the contents of a remote server folder in order to edit locally).
2. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac open command palette, run `SFTP: config` command.
3. A basic configuration file will appear named `sftp.json` under the `.vscode` directory, open and edit the configuration parameters with your remote server information.

For instance:
```json
{
    "name": "Profile Name",
    "host": "name_of_remote_host",
    "protocol": "ftp",
    "port": 21,
    "secure": true,
    "username": "username",
    "remotePath": "/public_html/project", // <--- This is the path which will be downloaded if you "Download Project"
    "password": "password",
    "uploadOnSave": false
}
```
The password parameter in `sftp.json` is optional, if left out you will be prompted for a password on sync.
_Note：_ backslashes and other special characters must be escaped with a backslash.

4. Save and close the `sftp.json` file.
5. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac open command palette.
6. Type `sftp` and you'll now see a number of other commands. You can also access many of the commands from the project's file explorer context menus.
7. A good one to start with if you want to sync with a remote folder is `SFTP: Download Project`.  This will download the directory shown in the `remotePath` setting in `sftp.json` to your local open directory.
8. Done - you can now edit locally and after each save it will upload to sync your remote file with the local copy.
9. Enjoy!

For detailed explanations, see the documentation files in `docs/`.

### Simple
```json
{
  "host": "host",
  "username": "username",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace"
}
```

### Profiles
```json
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "remotePath": "/remote/workspace/a",
  "watcher": {
    "files": "dist/*.{js,css}",
    "autoUpload": false
  },
  "profiles": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "dev-host",
      "remotePath": "/dev",
      "uploadOnSave": true
    },
    "prod": {
      "host": "prod-host",
      "remotePath": "/prod"
    }
  },
  "defaultProfile": "dev"
}
```

_Note：_ `context` and `watcher` are only available at root level.

Use `SFTP: Set Profile` to switch profile.

### Multiple Context
The context must **not be same**.
```json
[
  {
    "name": "server1",
    "context": "project/build",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/build"
  },
  {
    "name": "server2",
    "context": "project/src",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "remotePath": "/remote/project/src"
  }
]
```

_Note：_ `name` is required in this mode.

### Connection Hopping
You can connect to a target server through a proxy with ssh protocol.

_Note：_ Variable substitution is not working in a hop configuration.

#### Single Hop
local -> hop -> target
```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  // hop
  "host": "hopHost",
  "username": "hopUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/localUser/.ssh/id_rsa", // <-- The key file is assumed on the local.

  "hop": {
    // target
    "host": "targetHost",
    "username": "targetUsername",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopUser/.ssh/id_rsa", // <-- The key file is assumed on the hop.
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Hop
local -> hopa -> hopb -> target
```json
{
  "name": "target",
  "remotePath": "/path/in/target",

  // hopa
  "host": "hopAHost",
  "username": "hopAUsername",
  "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopAUsername/.ssh/id_rsa" // <-- The key file is assumed on the local.

  "hop": [
    // hopb
    {
      "host": "hopBHost",
      "username": "hopBUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopaUser/.ssh/id_rsa" // <-- The key file is assumed on the hopa.
    },

    // target
    {
      "host": "targetHost",
      "username": "targetUsername",
      "privateKeyPath": "/Users/hopbUser/.ssh/id_rsa", // <-- The key file is assumed on the hopb.
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration in User Setting
You can use `remote` to tell SFTP Sync to get the connection settings from the
`remotefs.remote` VS Code user setting.

In User Setting:
```json
"remotefs.remote": {
  "dev": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "rootPath": "/path/to/somewhere"
  },
  "projectX": {
    "scheme": "sftp",
    "host": "host",
    "username": "username",
    "privateKeyPath": "/Users/xx/.ssh/id_rsa",
    "rootPath": "/home/foo/some/projectx"
  }
}
```

In sftp.json:
```json
{
  "remote": "dev",
  "remotePath": "/home/xx/",
  "uploadOnSave": false,
  "ignore": [".vscode", ".git", ".DS_Store"]
}
```

## Remote Explorer
![remote-explorer-preview](./assets/showcase/remote-explorer.png)

Remote Explorer lets you explore files in remote. You can open Remote Explorer by:

1. Run Command `View: Show SFTP`.
2. Click SFTP view in Activity Bar.

You can only view a files content with Remote Explorer. Run command `SFTP: Edit in Local` to edit it in local.

### Multiple Select
You are able to select multiple files/folders at once on the remote server to download and upload. You can do it simply by holding down Ctrl or Shift while selecting all desired files, just like on the regular explorer view.

_Note：_ You need to manually refresh the parent folder after you **delete** a file if the explorer isn't correctly updated.

### Order
You can order the remote Explorer by adding the `remoteExplorer.order` parameter inside your `sftp.json` config file.

In sftp.json:
```json
{
  "remoteExplorer": {
    "order": 1 // <-- Default value is 0.
  }
}
```

## Debug
1. Open User Settings.
  - On Windows/Linux - `File > Preferences > Settings`
  - On macOS - `Code > Preferences > Settings`
2. Set `sftp.debug` to `true` and reload vscode.
3. View the logs in `View > Output > sftp`.
